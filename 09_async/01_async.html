<!-- async and await are features in many programming languages, especially in those that support asynchronous programming. 
They are commonly used in situations where certain operations may take some time to complete, such as I/O operations or network requests.
Instead of blocking the execution of code until the operation is complete,
async and await allow you to write asynchronous code that doesn't block the main thread, enabling more efficient use of resources.
Here are some common use cases for async and await:

Fetching Data from a Remote Server
Reading Files
Working with Promises
Concurrency
Event Handling
