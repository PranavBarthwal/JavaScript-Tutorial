The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources (including across the network). It is a more powerful and flexible replacement for XMLHttpRequest.

The global fetch() method starts the process of fetching a resource from the network, returning a promise that is fulfilled once the response is available.

The promise resolves to the Response object representing the response to your request.

A fetch() promise only rejects when a network error is encountered (which is usually when there's a permissions issue or similar). A fetch() promise does not reject on HTTP errors (404, etc.). Instead, a then() handler must check the Response.ok and/or Response.status properties.
agar humein error 404 ya 304 mila to vo as a response treat hoga, error sirf tb treat hoga agar vo network se request hi nhi kr paya

jb hum js engine se setTimeout type ka koi async fxn call krte hai then vo callback register krke task queue mein add krta jata h callbacks ko.  And event loop check krta rehta hai jese hi uss callback ka tme hota hai use js engine ke call satck mein daal deta hai and vo execute hojata hai.

noww during prmoises's tutorial we noticed that jo humnein fetch se resources mangaye the vo pehle exute hokr aagye the and baki ke fxn baadmein execute huye the. 
this is because fetch ke tasks ke liye alag special queue bnti hai, called MICROTASK QUEUE / FETCH QUEUE / PRIORITY QUEUE.
Microtask queue wale fxn ko pehle priority milti hai hmesha

jab hum fetch ko call krte hai to kaam hote hai 
1. Browser ki API ya Node ki API request handle krna through which we can do network request, 
   ab agar network request se kuch bhi data aaya to vo onfullfilled[] wali array mein store hoajyega. and agar network se connect nhi kr paye ya response aaya hi nhi then vo store hojayega onrejection[] wali array mein. 
   agar network se error 404 ka bhi response aaya to vo bhi as a response treat hoga and onfullfilled[] mein store hoga, as network se connect to kr hi liya tha.

2. Space reservation for variables in memory. it makes two arrays onfulfilled[] and onrejection[].
   onfulfilled represents promise's resolution and on rejection represents promise's rejection. we cant push elements in these arrays as we dont have their access.
   ab ye onfullfilled[] and onrejection[] mein hote hai fxn jo inke andar ke elements ko data mein daalte hai. and then data se value humare response mein chli jaati hai which is available in the global memory (response =  fetch("ghvcjhv.com"))
