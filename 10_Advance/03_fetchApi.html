The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources (including across the network). It is a more powerful and flexible replacement for XMLHttpRequest.

The global fetch() method starts the process of fetching a resource from the network, returning a promise that is fulfilled once the response is available.

The promise resolves to the Response object representing the response to your request.

A fetch() promise only rejects when a network error is encountered (which is usually when there's a permissions issue or similar). A fetch() promise does not reject on HTTP errors (404, etc.). Instead, a then() handler must check the Response.ok and/or Response.status properties.
agar humein error 404 ya 304 mila to vo as a response treat hoga, error sirf tb treat hoga agar vo network se request hi nhi kr paya
